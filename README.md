# Legends of Runeterra Deck Builder api
The Legends of Runeterra Deck Builder is a front-end web-app that uses JSON data from RIOT Games, HTML, and Javascript. The main
feature is a card sorter that will filter the cards based of the preferences in the select menus. All cards that are selected are
pushed to local storage. Users can then view the cards they've selected in the deck editor and remove them if they choose. There
is also an option to 'reset deck' to clear local storage and start from scratch. 

In the future I'd like to add a back-end where users can register an account and save decks that they've made to their profile. Styling
to the select buttons are needed to help distinguish the options more easily. Eventually figuring out a way to generate the deck code
to export to the live game is also a BIG next step.
